# Video Streaming Platform  
**Is a** backend-driven video streaming web application where users can upload videos, which are then processed using **FFmpeg**, converted into **HLS (.ts/.m3u8)** format, and streamed seamlessly.  

This project was built to demonstrate **backend engineering skills** such as background processing, queue management and scalable video transcoding.

## üß† Why This Project?  

I created this project to learn and showcase how to build a **production-ready video streaming service** similar to YouTube or Vimeo at a smaller scale.  

The project highlights:  

‚úÖ **Background queue with workers** to offload video processing  
‚úÖ **Video status tracking** (Ready, Processing, Failed)  
‚úÖ **HLS streaming support** for adaptive playback  
‚úÖ **Docker-ready** for consistent deployments
